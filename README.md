# Futbol
Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/) Futbol project.

## Check-in Plan
- scheduled 15 minute check-ins in the mornings
- check-ins via slack or github comments before merging pull requests

## Project Organization and Workflow
To manage our group's organization and workflow we are using GitHub projects 
([Link](https://github.com/users/elysableu/projects/5/views/1)).  In our project, 
we has used the backlog section to track what methods/tests that are currently being worked on and to delegate the individual methods to each member of our group.

## Project Design Approach
We first broke everything down into the smallest chunks that made sense.  We also used
the web application Miro ([Link](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLJwvjhA=/)) to help organize our thoughts.
Our collective decision was to create a seperate object class for each incoming .CSV file to ensure that the data 
was formatted correctly and easily accessible.

## Code Design Approach
Our code design approach was mostly encapsulated into our project design, although specifically we discussed our plan for sorting the data that was incoming and the advantages of storing it in an array or a hash.  We initialized instance variables to store those hashes with key/value pairs, where the keys were unique IDs found in (or concatenated from multiple ids in) the data sets and the pairs were the objects created in the teams, games, and game_teams classes.  To calculate the stats for the data in those instance variables, we instantiated modules to extract data from the collections of data to output the defined calculations.
